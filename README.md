# E_Commerce
ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Platform: Build and manage your online store with our customizable E-Commerce solution. Featuring user-friendly interfaces, secure payments and inventory
management.

The E-commerce Application is built on a robust technology stack, leveraging Django as the core framework and Django Rest Framework for seamless API development.

Celery for task management, which guarantees effective background processing, and AMQP for message queuing. 

Django Simple JWT provides enhanced authentication, while django-cors-headers enables safe resource sharing between origins. Django-sstorages improves storage capacities and 
allows for scalable management of media files. With capabilities like Django filter for streamlined data querying, the application prioritizes the user experience.

Pillow manages image-related tasks, ensuring high-quality visuals. With support for CSV exporting through django-queryset-csv, the app provides versatile data handling. 
These technologies collectively empower the E-commerce App, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and a feature-rich environment for both administrators and users.
							
Technologies Used
â€¢	Django's TestCase was used, allowing comprehensive testing of views, models, and other components. This ensured that new features or modifications meet the specified 
  requirements.
â€¢	Unit testing was extensively employed, focusing on individual components in isolation. Django's TestCase and the unittest module facilitate the creation of test cases 
  for functions, methods, and classes. Mocking is utilized to isolate dependencies, ensuring that tests are focused.
â€¢	Additionally, the E-Commerce application employed the Django Rest Framework's testing capabilities for API endpoints. This includes using the APIClient to simulate 
  HTTP requests and assert responses, verifying that the API functions as expected.
â€¢	The testing procedure is automated by the integration of GitHub Actions. By doing this, it is made sure that tests are run automatically with every code commit, 
  quickly detecting and fixing problems. The E-commerce Application's thorough testing approach improves code quality, reduces bugs, and fosters a reliable and 
  maintainable codebase.
